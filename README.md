# Detect the road by using matlab


The goal of the project is to detect boundaries of roads and fields. This project aims to identify the different line features in images that delineate fields such as roads, canals, or trails. The fact that the roads are not necessarily consistent in size, color, and shape makes this somewhat challenging. The techniques used in this project could potentially be used by a navigation software developer or a space-based photography company to draw the road from the ground truth images, or to identify the boundary of the road for future autonomous cars.
